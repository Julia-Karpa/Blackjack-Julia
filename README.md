# Blackjack Game
### Overview
This is a simple text-based Blackjack game written in Python. In this game, players try to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

### How to Play
The player and the dealer are each dealt two cards initially.

The player can choose to "hit" (draw a card) or "stand" (stop drawing cards).

The dealer follows a fixed set of rules to hit until their hand value is at least 17.

The goal is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding 21.

### Card Values
Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.

Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.

Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value is more beneficial for the hand.
